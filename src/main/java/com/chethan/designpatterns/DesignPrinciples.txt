SOLID Design Principles-
SRP -
    * Single Responsibility Principle
    * One class should have one and only one responsibility

OCP -
    * Open Closed Principle
    * Software components should be open for extension, but closed for modification
    * extend the class and override some functions

LSP -
    * Liskovâ€™s Substitution Principle
    * Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types

ISP -
    * Interface Segregation Principle
    * Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which they will not use

DIP -
    * Dependency Inversion Principle
    * Depend on abstractions, not on concretions
