System.exit()
When System.exit is called, the virtual machine performs two cleanup tasks before shutting down.
    * Stops all program threads immediately; it does not cause finally blocks to execute
    * Executes all shutdown hooks that have been registered with Runtime.addShutdownHook
    * If either System.runFinalizersOnExit or its evil twin Runtime.runFinalizersOnExit has been called,
      the VM runs the finalizers on all objects that have not yet been finalized.
    * It is possible to halt the VM without executing shutdown hooks by calling System.halt
